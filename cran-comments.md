First submission

This package uses a bucket-sorting algorithm to avoid useless storage and computations in sparse contingency tables when comparing two classifications with many entries. It is then used to compute fastly adjusted Rand index and other clustering comparison measures.

The devlopment version is available on github https://github.com/jchiquet/aricode
